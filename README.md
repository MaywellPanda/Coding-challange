# Coding-challange
coding challange, the first iterate code is my own code and the second isn't.
I have no prior experince coding but i am famallair with it, in a limited sense. 
The solution i provided upon further research did not meet the requirements, i did reach out for clarification of this issue as the question was worded strangely.
I was not able to get help in time although upon researching i feel the second code file i added would eventually lead me to a solution or atleast in the correct direction of a solution to this problem.
