#This was my first time coding in python upon closer inspection of the question i felt that this code i wrote didn't meet the requirements.
#i have included a second bit of code NOT WRITTEN BY ME, that i feel would lead to the correct solution ( allthough the question was confusing to me)

#question:In a language of your choice, using all best practice principles you’re aware of, could you please provide code that 
#iterates in multiples of A until X, then in multiples of A + 1 until 2X, then multiples of A + 2 until 3X. Please state any assumptions you’ve made

#For this code i allowed X to = 0 and A = 1
